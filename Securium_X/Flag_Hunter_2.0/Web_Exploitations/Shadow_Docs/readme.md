## Solution

In this challenge, We are first greeted with a Login page. As confident as I am, I directly opened the inspector and found the user name and password as comments in the HTML script.

As we logged in, we are presented with a Dashboard with variety of items to shop from. I interacted with each item, and saw the output it gives.

I interacted with the page, clicking buy , which shows a page saying that i have purchased.

I then inspected the page to see what is flaw, and then found out that the code has a discount option which was hidden. Of course, as curious as I am, I changed the discount amount to 100 to make sure the purchased price will not be considered.

I changed every items discount to 100 and clicked on every item to purchase. When i clicked on the "Golden Cookie", with the discount changed to 100, The flag was displayed.
