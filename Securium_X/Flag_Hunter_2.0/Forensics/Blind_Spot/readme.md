In this challenge, We are told to download a file called [filename]

After downloading it, there were various folders 

I then inspected the page and went straight to the cookies as that is what the challenge is about.

I noticed in the cookies section that the value of the cookie is -1.

I then changed the value of the cookie to 2, and reloaded the page. The output displayed a cookie name.

So I changed the numbers until i reached 18, and VOILA!!!!!
