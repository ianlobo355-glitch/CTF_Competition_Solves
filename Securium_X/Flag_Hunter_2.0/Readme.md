I name Myself Selenium in this competition, just because I had no other creative names and Selenium sounds cool to me.

I participated in Flag Hunter 2.0 which was held on 25th October 2025 to 27th October 2025.

This was my first CTF competition, I never attended any of them until then. 

This was really a good experience and i learned a lot of stuffs in those 2 days than i had in courses and college. I also came to know how CTF competitons are held and got some insights to it. 

I did my best, thats what I believe, based on the amount of knowledge I have till then. I saw other players ranks and scores too, and that gave me a drive to Improve, Adapt and Conquer.
